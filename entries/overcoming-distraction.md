# Overcoming distraction

Things were finally going well, I was finally walking the path I had always wanted to - I was learning, experimenting and creating value
for myself - I was happy, and then out of the blue, something happens, something very personal, which sucked all
the spirit out of me, making me feel hollow, purposeless and vulnerable. This last month was excruciatingly hard for me.

## This is something that I had never experienced before
This wasn't just the cute old depresssion which just made me feel like crying as soon as I wake up for absolutely no reason whatsoever - it
more or less looked like a systemic attack on myself. At first, it was just restlessness and lack of energy, and then there was shock, followed by confusion and mental stress. - I was
surprised and suddenly taken aback by the extent of how impactful little things could be. I wasn't just feeling regular low, programmer's block. It
felt as if I was an imposter, a cheat or a criminal - the stupid wrong doer. It only kept digging deeper until the point where it manifested itself as physical pain, which
felt good to be honest - It would take away all my thoughts for a while.

I knew that a little more strength and I would past it, but no matter what, that strength wouldn't show up.
Then things took a different unexpected toll, I went towards TV, a thing which I always found caustic. It had an effect of temporary
salvation which yielded me in a state of always wanting more - The infinite loop of hell.

## Bad ideas are good
I hadn't been reading much, other than the freak stories that would show up in my inbox, but gladly one of my friends pointed me to
[Akimbo](https://www.akimbo.me/) - A podcast from Seth Godin dedicated to culture and how we can change it. His way of reasoning
appealed to me uniquely - crisp, clear and insightful. I had to binge listen to it. After trying out a couple of episodes and awing at them,
I found this masterpiece - ["No such thing as writer's block"][0] which presented the idea of bad ideas:

*The idea that we are going to create more and more bad work on our way to good work is one way to unlock the myth, to get past the stuckness.* 

And bam, this was absolutely phenomenal - All I need to recover right now was to show up, to just arrive and do my part - This one explicit encounter with
my lost conscience profoundly reminded me of what I had been forgetting all along - the art of owning the responsibility and not deferring it.

*Take your time, think and do - It really is that simple, it isn't just that easy.*

And it makes all the difference.
