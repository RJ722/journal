# So, what changed this March?

A lot! - Let me give a brief summary

I applied to Google Summer of Code again - My primary task would be to create a
script which would help create a whitelist for projects which use sip for
creating Python bindings from C/C++.


New softwares in life:
- I started using Thunderbird for managing my emails, along with EnigMail for
PGP - [Find my key here](https://rj722.tech/public.txt). [How to?](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-use-pgp-mac-os-x)
- I started using [weechat](https://weechat.org/) for IRC and I am absolutely
loving it.
- I also configured [EliteBNC](https://www.elitebnc.org/) so that I don't miss
any messages when I am AFK. I go by the username RJ722 on **irc.freenode.net**
- I've started using torBrowser to protect myself against online spying. I've
been following [Surveillance Self-Defense](https://ssd.eff.org) lately.
- I've been trying to switch to vim, but it gets painful when I try to get any
real work done, I am awfully slow.

[EDIT]:
- And, I've started using KeePassXC for managing my passwords.

Other plans:

- I plan to start contributing to [qutebrowser](https://www.qutebrowser.org)
soon - It's also the primary reason I'm trying to learn how to use vim. Also,
the project is very well managed and will help me get to know my mentor.
- I am gonna start preparing for MS (Robotics, perhaps).

Setting up this diary is turning out to be a bliss - I feel like it would help
me write more frequently, perhaps because a lot less structure is expected in a
post. I plan to use it primarily for thinking out loud and for any comments I'd
have.
