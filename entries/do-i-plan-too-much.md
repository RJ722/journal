# Do I plan too much?

For quite sometime, I've noticed that I am never out of ideas, but nearly
everytime I fail to deliver a product based on that. Why? Perhaps, because I
sub-consiously keep reminding myself of the next thing I need to do, never
actually concentrating enough on the task at hand. Yes, planning in advance can
turn out to be productive, but far too much definitely hinders with your ability
of getting things done, even a vague idea of what "could" be done next is enough
I guess.

The same happens with whatever MOOC's I start - I won't be 2 weeks in, but would
already be looking for what next and therefore, guess what - I don't bother to
completing the former, because I need to "try out" the new one.

But, I think that by impelling myself into doing whatever I am doing right now
and trying to be more "disciplined", less "organised", I would be okay to go.

Thanks for Reading!
